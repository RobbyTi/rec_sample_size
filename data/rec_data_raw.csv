Orthopaedic Surgery Department. As the Department consists of 12 junior
residents (PGY 1/2), 18 senior residents (PGY 3/4/5), and many attendings, it
was determined that a total of 30 resident participants are likely available for
this study. Medical student group size was chosen to be consistent with junior
resident availability. The construct validity arm of the study will require 30
total participants. Ten junior residents, 15 senior residents, and 5 attendings.

For sequential designs, describe the desired strength of evidence or stopping rule, what range of sample sizes are expected, and what is the probability of misleading evidence.
In some cases, it may be useful to perform a sensitivity analysis to establish the smallest effect size that could be detected given the computed sample size and to indicate what the anticipated effect size might be.
