name: Research Ethics Committees as an intervention point to promote a priori sample
  size calculations
description: Studies in the health and life sciences often use sample sizes too small
  to robustly answer the research questions at hand. By performing a formal sample
  size calculation before beginning a study, researchers can overcome this issue.
  One potential avenue to promote the uptake of sample size calculation is through
  Research Ethics Committees (RECs). We assessed template ethics submission forms
  from 10 RECs from research-intensive universities in each of the United States and
  the United Kingdom (for 20 forms in total). We found that 19 of them requested that
  researchers provide the planned sample size, 12 requested a justification of the
  sample size, and 6 requested a sample size calculation. Future research could investigate
  the effectiveness of sample size requests from RECs and compare this approach to
  intervening through other mechanisms, such as Scientific Review Committees or funding
  agencies.
